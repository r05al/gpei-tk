      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
      <p>Developing a detailed situation analysis may seem like a lot of work, but it is the essential first step to developing any communication strategy, whether for the first time, or whether considering revisions to an existing strategy. In the case of outbreaks or other emergencies, you may not have the time or depth of knowledge you would like but any research, stakeholder engagement or analysis at this stage will only make your efforts more effective.
      A situation analysis should take a large part of your time, but is should not be seen as a finite activity. It should be a constant process of evaluation and reassessment to ensure your research and assumptions hold up as your programme matures.</p>
      <p>A situation analysis is about understanding the context in which you're operating, being precise about what problems you are trying to address, and using data effectively to tailor your response.
      Most importantly it helps you to understand the disease and the behavior, both desired and current, from the perspective of your target communities.<p>
      <p>It begins to answer questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What's the problem?</li>
        <li>Who is it affecting?</li>
        <li>What are the effects of the problem?</li>
        <li>Where does the problem exist and what do we know about the context?</li>
        <li>What factors facilitate or impede the problem?</li>
        <li>What factors facilitate or impede the behavioural change?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For polio it can simply be boiled down to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where are the under-immunized/missed children?</li>
        <li>Who are they?</li>
        <li>Why are they under-immunized/missed?</li>
        <li>What are the root reasons?</li>
        <li>Will parents seek OPV or accept it each time it is offered?</li>
        <li>What are the best ways to engage parents and communities?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Drafting a problem statement can be a helpful way to keep the team focused on the critical issue to be addressed.
      In polio eradication, this means starting your analysis with a good understanding of the broad issue we need to confront – whether it's awareness, misinformation, not available children or community trust. A quality problem statement defines the issue through the ‘5Ws' in one or two concise sentences.</p>
      <p><strong>Some sample problem statements:</strong></p>
      <p>First-time mothers among pastoralists in Ethiopia have low awareness of vaccination and very low routine immunization rates.</p>
      <p>Grandfathers are not supportive of polio vaccination in Kandahar Province as they feel their boys will be sterilized by the vaccine.</p>
      <p>In these examples, we have named the health issue (vaccination / polio vaccination), indicated who is most affected (pastoralists / grandfathers), where (pastoralist communities in northern Ethiopia / Kandahar Province) and, if known at this stage, the apparent role for communications (awareness and disease education / misinformation and paternal concern of vaccination).</p>
      <p>These cues help guide and target our situation analysis and sets us up for a useful and relevant communication objective.</p>
      <p><strong>Formative Research</strong></p>
      <p>Begin with a desk review, gathering any and all relevant data you have – these might include reports, guidelines, research, existing practices, policies, planning guidelines, dashboard information, survey data etc. Look for data that includes information about bottlenecks, root causes, existing and past program responses, the media and communications environment as well as data that has a specific C4D focus.</p>
      <p>More than likely your desk review will have identified information gaps and most importantly highlighted where best to engage with the caregiver and the communities themselves for more detailed context.</p>
      <p>This primary research can include observation, discussions with community members, more formal focus groups, in-depth interviews and surveys. It can tell you invaluable things about your research and behavioural assumptions. Don't forget to gather information on the perceived cost of the behavior, on the spiritual influence in daily life and health decisions, as well as seasonal, moral, legal, cultural and familial issues that could impact the adoption or even longer term maintenance of a given behavior.</p>
      <p>After you've gathered the detailed information about what the problem is and why it's occurring, a table like this one can help you to better organize your thoughts as to why the problem behavior is happening:</p>
